	speechRecog("I am sort of new to using speech recognition in my programs, and I think you may be able to give some insight. With using Winspeech, is this module always listening once the callback is initiated? If I wanted to, let's say, allow a user to conduct a google search with their voice, how do I first call the search and then not allow the voice input for the search to impact the larger programmatic process? For instance, you start up the program, you say google search, the program activates the google search function. Now all input from the voice will be to perform the google search. But how can I differentiate these inputs: General selections from specific processes?ï»¿",winspeech.listen_for_anything(speechRecog))
